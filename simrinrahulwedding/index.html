                        <p>Rahul and I met when I was just 14 years old. We met at my cousin’s wedding in 2006 where Rahul wooed me with his guitar playing skills. Although there were no sparks at such a young age, Rahul and I rekindled our friendship in 2009. We became best friends and I couldn’t survive a day without talking to him! He was the perfect penpal! Pal, being the operative word in that sentence. Although I had plans of friendship, Rahul had other plans. As I planned a trip to Toronto and Boston, I mentioned it to my penpal and he asked for my ticket information. Little did I know, Rahul slyly booked a ticket to Toronto and Boston based on my tickets! He 
                        surprised me in Toronto and I was so excited to see him. His charming smile and innocent eyes made fall head over heels in love with him, and I never looked back! We began our love story as a long distance relationship with me in California and Rahul in Lagos. We wrote love notes, sent care packages, had endless skype dates and beefed up our parents phone bills for close to 2 years of our relationship. In 2010, I made a move to New York for college. In 2013, Rahul made the move to New York to attend business school and our long distance relationship was finally put to rest! We made loads of friends, traveled to many cities, raised a dog, and graduated hand in hand in 2014. In 2015, Rahul proposed to me at my favorite place in New York City. I am the luckiest person in the world because I get to marry my best friend.</p>

Messages in bottles have become a tradition between us and we each have empty wine bottles with sand in them with gushy love notes from one another.</p>

                In 2011, Rahul and I couldn’t be together for Valentine’s Day, so Rahul turned on 
                skype, set up a table in his room with a candle, table cloth and a 3 course meal. He ordered delivery for me to my college dorm and we celebrated our first valentine’s day together, virtually. It was perfect.</p>
                <p class="firstlook sev-posi txt-rt"> ​In 2013, Rahul took me to a puppy store (against my will) because he wanted to convince me it was a good idea to get a dog for himself. I fell in love with a dog and cried at the store because I couldn’t take it home. He took me to iHop (because he knows how to make me happy). Our dog, Gatsby, is now 2 years old.</p>
                <p class="firstlook eigt-posi txt-rt">​
                On February 14, 2015, Rahul organized for me to get a massage with my sister on 
                Valentines day morning. I came back to my apartment filled with a rose petal path toward a message in a bottle. The note told me to go to the pier we used to take our dog almost every day in the summer to eat brunch. I reached the pier to Rahul surrounded in a circle of roses he dug into the snow. He proposed and made me the happiest girl on earth!</p>
