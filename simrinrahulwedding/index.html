                        <p>Rahul and I met when I was just 14 years old. We met at my cousin’s wedding in 2006 where Rahul wooed me with his guitar playing skills. Although there were no sparks at such a young age, Rahul and I rekindled our friendship in 2009. We became best friends and I couldn’t survive a day without talking to him! He was the perfect penpal! Pal, being the operative word in that sentence. Although I had plans of friendship, Rahul had other plans. As I planned a trip to Toronto and Boston, I mentioned it to my penpal and he asked for my ticket information. Little did I know, Rahul slyly booked a ticket to Toronto and Boston based on my tickets! He 
                        surprised me in Toronto and I was so excited to see him. His charming smile and innocent eyes made fall head over heels in love with him, and I never looked back! We began our love story as a long distance relationship with me in California and Rahul in Lagos. We wrote love notes, sent care packages, had endless skype dates and beefed up our parents phone bills for close to 2 years of our relationship. In 2010, I made a move to New York for college. In 2013, Rahul made the move to New York to attend business school and our long distance relationship was finally put to rest! We made loads of friends, traveled to many cities, raised a dog, and graduated hand in hand in 2014. In 2015, Rahul proposed to me at my favorite place in New York City. I am the luckiest person in the world because I get to marry my best friend.</p>

                    Early 2012, Simrin paid me a surprise visit in London on my birthday
                    I was out there studying for the GMAT exam. She has always been my
                    support system and goes the extra mile (in this case about 3,500 miles) to
                    make things work.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook secn-posi">
                    Late 2012, on our 3rd Anniversary, Simrin made me a photo book
                    recapping some of the best times we had experienced together. At the
                    end of the book were two tickets to see Jason Mraz at Madison Square
                    Garden. It is still one of the best shows we’ve seen together.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook thd-posi">
                    In 2013, Valentine’s Day, Simrin got into my apartment before I got home
                    from class, and decorated the entire living room with heart-shaped helium
                    balloons. On each balloon was a picture of the two of us, complete with a
                    scavenger hunt.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook frth-posi">
                    In 2014, I picked out a ring for her; I knew I wanted to spend the rest of
                    life with her long before I actually proposed.

                <p class="firstlook fiv-posi txt-rt">
                    In 2006, Rahul played “Message in a Bottle” by John Mayer on the guitar and blew me
                    away with his talent. Messages in bottles have become a tradition between us and we each
                    have empty wine bottles with sand in them with gushy love notes from one another.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook six-posi txt-rt"> ​
                    In 2011, Rahul and I couldn’t be together for Valentine’s Day, so Rahul turned on skype,
                    set up a table in his room with a candle, table cloth and a 3 course meal. He ordered delivery for
                    me to my college dorm and we celebrated our first valentine’s day together, virtually. It was
                    perfect.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook sev-posi txt-rt" style="width: 322px;">
                    In 2013, Rahul took me to a puppy store (against my will) because he wanted to
                    convince me it was a good idea to get a dog for himself. I fell in love with a dog and cried at the
                    store because I couldn’t take it home. He took me to iHop (because he knows how to make me
                    happy). Our dog, Gatsby, is now 2 years old.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook eigt-posi txt-rt" style="width:271px;">​
                    On February 14, 2015, Rahul organized for me to get a massage with my sister on
                    Valentines day morning. I came back to my apartment filled with a rose petal path toward a
                    message in a bottle. The note told me to go to the pier we used to take our dog almost every
                    day in the summer to eat brunch. I reached the pier to Rahul surrounded in a circle of roses he
                    dug into the snow. He proposed and made me the happiest girl on earth!

Once while driving, he was pulled over by cops, and when moving over towards to sidewalk, he sliced a tire on the pavement. Not only did he talk his way out of a speeding ticket, he also convinced the cops to change the tire for him. We’ve shared too many memories to summarize in a paragraph. From road trips to summer holidays, tennis camp to World Cups, boarding school in London to college years in Boston - things have always been a lot easier with him around.</div>

Although we’ve only known each other for a few years, Ian has become one of my closest friends. He’s the reliable friend that you know is always down to drink at Sweet Leaf, or ready to hit the city for night out. One of my best memories with him is the trip we took down to Miami in 2014 where we spent 15 minutes talking our way into a night club at 2AM, only to get in find it was completely empty. He’s also the only guy I know who has the energy to party till 4 in the morning, and then still be alive enough to wake me up at 7AM for breakfast – a useful skill for this wedding.</div>
