                        <p>Rahul and I met when I was just 14 years old. We met at my cousin’s wedding in 2006 where Rahul wooed me with his guitar playing skills. Although there were no sparks at such a young age, Rahul and I rekindled our friendship in 2009. We became best friends and I couldn’t survive a day without talking to him! He was the perfect penpal! Pal, being the operative word in that sentence. Although I had plans of friendship, Rahul had other plans. As I planned a trip to Toronto and Boston, I mentioned it to my penpal and he asked for my ticket information. Little did I know, Rahul slyly booked a ticket to Toronto and Boston based on my tickets! He 
                        surprised me in Toronto and I was so excited to see him. His charming smile and innocent eyes made fall head over heels in love with him, and I never looked back! We began our love story as a long distance relationship with me in California and Rahul in Lagos. We wrote love notes, sent care packages, had endless skype dates and beefed up our parents phone bills for close to 2 years of our relationship. In 2010, I made a move to New York for college. In 2013, Rahul made the move to New York to attend business school and our long distance relationship was finally put to rest! We made loads of friends, traveled to many cities, raised a dog, and graduated hand in hand in 2014. In 2015, Rahul proposed to me at my favorite place in New York City. I am the luckiest person in the world because I get to marry my best friend.</p>

                    Early 2012, Simrin paid me a surprise visit in London on my birthday
                    I was out there studying for the GMAT exam. She has always been my
                    support system and goes the extra mile (in this case about 3,500 miles) to
                    make things work.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook secn-posi">
                    Late 2012, on our 3rd Anniversary, Simrin made me a photo book
                    recapping some of the best times we had experienced together. At the
                    end of the book were two tickets to see Jason Mraz at Madison Square
                    Garden. It is still one of the best shows we’ve seen together.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook thd-posi">
                    In 2013, Valentine’s Day, Simrin got into my apartment before I got home
                    from class, and decorated the entire living room with heart-shaped helium
                    balloons. On each balloon was a picture of the two of us, complete with a
                    scavenger hunt.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook frth-posi">
                    In 2014, I picked out a ring for her; I knew I wanted to spend the rest of
                    life with her long before I actually proposed.

                <p class="firstlook fiv-posi txt-rt">
                    In 2006, Rahul played “Message in a Bottle” by John Mayer on the guitar and blew me
                    away with his talent. Messages in bottles have become a tradition between us and we each
                    have empty wine bottles with sand in them with gushy love notes from one another.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook six-posi txt-rt"> ​
                    In 2011, Rahul and I couldn’t be together for Valentine’s Day, so Rahul turned on skype,
                    set up a table in his room with a candle, table cloth and a 3 course meal. He ordered delivery for
                    me to my college dorm and we celebrated our first valentine’s day together, virtually. It was
                    perfect.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook sev-posi txt-rt" style="width: 322px;">
                    In 2013, Rahul took me to a puppy store (against my will) because he wanted to
                    convince me it was a good idea to get a dog for himself. I fell in love with a dog and cried at the
                    store because I couldn’t take it home. He took me to iHop (because he knows how to make me
                    happy). Our dog, Gatsby, is now 2 years old.
                </p>
                <p class="firstlook eigt-posi txt-rt" style="width:271px;">​
                    On February 14, 2015, Rahul organized for me to get a massage with my sister on
                    Valentines day morning. I came back to my apartment filled with a rose petal path toward a
                    message in a bottle. The note told me to go to the pier we used to take our dog almost every
                    day in the summer to eat brunch. I reached the pier to Rahul surrounded in a circle of roses he
                    dug into the snow. He proposed and made me the happiest girl on earth!

Once while driving, he was pulled over by cops, and when moving over towards to sidewalk, he sliced a tire on the pavement. Not only did he talk his way out of a speeding ticket, he also convinced the cops to change the tire for him. We’ve shared too many memories to summarize in a paragraph. From road trips to summer holidays, tennis camp to World Cups, boarding school in London to college years in Boston - things have always been a lot easier with him around.</div>

Although we’ve only known each other for a few years, Ian has become one of my closest friends. He’s the reliable friend that you know is always down to drink at Sweet Leaf, or ready to hit the city for night out. One of my best memories with him is the trip we took down to Miami in 2014 where we spent 15 minutes talking our way into a night club at 2AM, only to get in find it was completely empty. He’s also the only guy I know who has the energy to party till 4 in the morning, and then still be alive enough to wake me up at 7AM for breakfast – a useful skill for this wedding.</div>

                                        Samica is my Mickey Mouse. The two of us have always been two peas of a pod, we
                                        both liked all the same Disney TV shows, shared a love for music, sang numerous
                                        covers together, loved traveling, and even eventually fell in love with brothers haha!
                                        Some of my favorite memories with Micki are: The time I convinced her Martha Stewart
                                        invented fondant, the time I snuck her into a nightclub when the bouncer wasn’t looking,
                                        all the times we screamed in crowds, “That’s my sister!!”, the time when we got yelled at
                                        by a lady in her middle school parking lot for cutting her off and so on. I love Samica
                                        with all my heart and can’t wait to celebrate my big day with her.

                                        Sonam Kaushik is my big sister who is always the first one to get the party started and
                                        the last one to stumble home. I remember when I was younger, I always thought she
                                        was so cool. She was the first one to get her license (she officially became my
                                        chauffeur), first one to see rated R movies, first one to get a boyfriend and so one and
                                        so forth. One of my favorite memories of Sonam Didi is when we were babies and I kept
                                        trying to dance in her video. She kept pushing me away because I was trying to steal
                                        her spotlight. Haha! I quickly learned it’s impossible to steal the spotlight
                                        because no one can compete with such a gem of a person.

                                        Shina Vohra came along a year after me. Weighing in at 11 pounds, Miss Thunder Thighs
                                        became my Shina baby. We grew up playing “McDonalds”, “Cinderella” in the bathtub, “Sharks”
                                        on the marble tiles; eventually growing into a mutual obsession of the ABC channel.
                                        My favorite memory of Shina is when we went to India (without the parents) for the first time.
                                        We got into a fight before boarding our 13 hour flight back to San Francisco and were so upset
                                        we decided to sit on opposite ends of the plane because we couldn’t storm out of the room as
                                        we would normally do… We were stuck thousands of feet above the ground and many rows apart.
                                        I still get a chuckle over this.

                                        Sana Bakshi will always be my first love. Our love story began in 2nd grade (where we
                                        hated each other) and her mother forced her to invite me to her birthday party. As my
                                        mom got me into the car, we found out that she lived in the same neighborhood as me!
                                        Since then, we have been inseparable. From playdates, to movie dates, to mall dates to
                                        just plain old dates… Sana has always been more than a best friend to me. My favorite
                                        memory of Sana is when we were in High School, without fail, Sana would pack me a
                                        sandwich every day for lunch (because she knew I would always forget my lunch) and
                                        buy me a cookie in between classes. She was the best (house)wife a girl could ask for!

                                        Claire Kim and I were destined to be friends. Our puppies fell in love first, so it was
                                        inevitable that Claire and I were made for each other! Although we have only been
                                        friends for a few years, it feels like I have known Claire all of my life. My favorite
                                        memory of Claire is when we all went apple picking with our dogs and came home with
                                        100’s of apples and had no idea what to do with it. Claire came up with the idea to make
                                        apple strudel which progressed to us making a 1 minute film on the steps to making
                                        apple strudel with Claire jumping out at the camera. Needless to say, she is the next
                                        Martha Stewart... We have people calling from the Food Network 10 times a day.

                                        Tory Kamen is one of the most special people in my life. From living in the same dorm
                                        to living in the same room, Tory and I have shared a lot more than our beds. Some of
                                        my favorite memories of Tory are: Having the cameras called on us in a casino in
                                        Atlantic City, her trying to stop a fight by sticking her hand between Rahul and a guy
                                        and confidently saying, “HE’S FROM NIGERIA,” meeting FBI agents, officially scarring
                                        Tory of bananas at Laf, Tory killing our pet fish “Chicken and Waffles” within 24 hours,
                                        taking pictures of Tory and trees, always having to call the super for more keys because
                                        Tory kept losing them and so much more. I love Tory more than words can express.

                                        Priyanka Padode is the yin to my yang. We both joined NY Masti together in college and
                                        would spend more time together than I would with many of my other friends. We
                                        instantly connected with our love of music and created beautiful arrangements together.
                                        My favorite memories with Priyanka include: Diwali dinner on the longest table I’ve ever
                                        seen, long bus rides to Masti performances, sangria obsessions, hating on Alia Bhatt,
                                        getting hyped over every one of Priyanka’s birthdays, shopping every Zara sale
                                        together, comparing options for facebook profile pictures from Masti photo shoots, and
                                        so much more.

                                        Ananya Lalwani is one of the happiest people I know. Her positive energy and smile
                                        makes all of your worries go away. Ananya and I met at NYU through common friends
                                        and instantly bonded. It felt as though I had known her all of my life. My favorite memory
                                        of Ananya is our ski trip we took in college where we were the only girls in a sea of guys
                                        on the trip. My favorite time with Anans is a tie between when we decided it was a smart
                                        idea to get into the jacuzzi in below freezing temperature as well as watching Ananya
                                        skiing for the first time and zooming down the bunny slopes, nearly killing many
                                        children. I will always remember the “Ananya and Simrin Ski Trip”

                                        Rishika Assomull is the Disneyland of people. Happiest person on earth! My favorite
                                        moment of Rishika is a funny one (that she will kill me for writing). It all started in my
                                        cousin, Misha’s bridal suite when I badly needed to use the restroom. I ran and opened
                                        the restroom door but little did I know, Rishika was in the shower. I shut the door quickly
                                        as I heard Rishika squeal and yell. I could hear her sobbing through the door and I felt
                                        so bad. I remember running and getting candy and bringing it to Rishika after she
                                        finished showering. Needless to say, the candy made the whole situation better and she
                                        even shared it with me! I bet you don’t remember this at all Ika!

                                        Ragini Roy is such a beautiful person, inside and out. We met through our love of
                                        singing in our a cappella group, NY Masti. From partying to singing, Rags and I did it all!
                                        Some of my favorite moments with Ragini are: When we went clubbing in DC and were
                                        the only non-black people in the club (I guess I should get used to this! haha), our
                                        countless talks on relationships, drinks on more rooftops I can count, and constantly
                                        trying to convince her to beat box for me. New York wouldn’t have been the same
                                        without my Rags!

                                        Noel Shipp was one of the first people I met when I started at New York University. I

                                        of my favorites include: convincing her ebola was in New Jersey, taking pictures of her
                                        dancing by herself in every bar we went to, watching every Shonda Rhimes produced
                                        movie together, getting all my outfits approved by her and more!

                                        Natasha Chitkara and I were destined to be friends. Our mother’s were actually best
                                        friends before either of us were born! One of my favorite moments with Natasha was
                                        when we were in middle school and she had her locker across from mine. She would
                                        always come to my locker and leave me notes telling me about her day and I would do
                                        the same to her! As we got older, locker notes evolved to numerous selfies of one
                                        another on each other’s cell phones. Needless to say, not only does Natasha hold a
                                        special place in my heart, she also holds a special place on my hard drive with a record-
                                        breaking number of selfies.
